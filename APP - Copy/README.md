- **Extensible**: Easy to add new venues with their configurations

### Example Flow
```
1. User selects "Bukit Jalil Stadium" on map
   ‚Üí Bot: "üìç Location selected: Bukit Jalil Stadium (3.0480,101.6800). 
           Known capacity=50,000, gates A‚ÄìD suggested. Please confirm or edit."

2. User uploads Excel with attendance & timings
   ‚Üí Bot: "üìÇ Loaded attendance=48,700, start=7:30 PM, end=11:00 PM. 
           Gates missing. Using suggested gates from location. Please confirm."

3. User confirms
   ‚Üí Bot: "‚úÖ Event setup complete. Here's your summary card‚Ä¶ [Proceed to Simulation]."
```
